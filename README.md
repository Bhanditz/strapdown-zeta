# Strapdown.js with MathJax support

Strapdown.js makes it embarrassingly simple to create elegant Markdown documents. No server-side compilation required. 

And what's more, I added [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) support.

For more, please see:

## Build

```
$ npm install
$ grunt
```

The generated file would be `build/strapdown.min.js` and `build/strapdown.min.css`
